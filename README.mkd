bashpider
=========

a spider using nothing but standard unix tools (+ ruby glue)

    git clone whatever
    cd bashpider
    rake data:get_urls # will take a while 
    rake crawl:restart # this will run a crawl

If you want to monitor the downloads per second, in another window type the following:

    rake crawl:watch

When you feel you've gathered enough data, CTRL-C to kill both windows and then type:

    rake results:process
